  abstract = {This paper describes a study of the adhesion between elastic solids
	and the effect of roughness in reducing the adhesion. The experiments
	were carried out between optically smooth rubber spheres and a hard
	smooth flat surface of Perspex which could be roughened to various
	degrees. The radius of the rubber spheres was varied by a factor
	of 8, their elastic modulus by a factor of 10, while the centre line
	average (c.l.a.)of the roughened Perspex surface was varied from
	0.12 to 1.5 $\mu $m. The results show that c.l.a. roughnesses which
	are small compared with the overall deformation occurring at the
	region of the rubber-Perspex contact can produce an extremely large
	reduction in adhesion. The effect is more marked for rubbers of higher
	modulus. On the other hand the curvature of the sphere (over the
	range examined) has little influence. For this reason and because
	the analytical problem of a sphere on a rough flat is extremely complicated
	a theoretical analysis has been developed for the simpler case of
	a smooth flat in contact with a rough flat surface. As in Greenwood
	& Williamson (1966) the rough surface is modelled by asperities all
	of the same radius of curvature and with heights following a Gaussian
	distribution of standard deviation $\sigma $. The overall contact
	force is obtained by applying the contact theory of Johnson, Kendall
	& Roberts (1971) to each individual asperity. The theory predicts
	that the adhesion expressed as a fraction of the maximum value depends
	upon a single parameter, 1/$\Delta $$_{\text{c}}$, which is the ratio
	between $\sigma $ and the elastic displacement $\delta $$_{\text{c}}$
	that the tip of an asperity can sustain before it pulls off from
	the other surface. The analysis shows that the adhesion parameter
	may also be regarded as representing the statistical average of a
	competition between the compressive forces exerted by the higher
	asperities trying to prize the surfaces apart and the adhesive forces
	between the lower asperities trying to hold the surfaces together.
	Although the theory is derived for two nominally plane surfaces it
	is found to fit the experimental results for a sphere on a flat reasonably
	well.},

	as a work of adhesion, and is critical as it determines the level
	of non-flatness and patterning that may be tolerated in bonding.
	Traditionally, it has been assumed that the work of adhesion that
	drives the formation of the bond is equal to the work of separation
	that is measured through fracture tests, such as the familiar razor-blade
	test. In the present work, we use a novel test structure to measure
	both the work of separation and the work of adhesion of room temperature
	hydrophilic Si-Si bonds as a function of relative humidity (\~{}15
	‚Äì 50\% RH). The results show that across a range of values of RH,
	the work of adhesion is significantly lower than the work of separation.},

	surface energy of two bonded wafers, which is associated with the
	energy required to separate bonded wafers. In the present paper the
	dependence of the measured surface energy of bonded silicon wafers
	on the time after insertion of a blade at various pressures, silanol
	group densities, and annealing temperatures is reported. At normal
	conditions (air pressure, room temperature, 30% humidity) a strong
	dependence of the effective surface energy on the insertion time
	is found for wafers which were annealed at 200, 400, and 900√Ç¬∞C.
	For bonded wafers without subsequent annealing this phenomenon is
	not observed. Additional measurements under reduced pressure show
	that the debonding process appears to be related to the adsorption
	and chemical reaction of water molecules at sites of broken bonds
	at the opened surfaces. We conclude that a meaningful comparison
	of measured surface energies requires detailed information on the

	measurements were used to determine critical surface tensions of
	wetting and work of adhesion values. Contact angle measurements indicate
	that polishing does indeed make the 
	
	 surfaces more wettable through the formation of silanols. This is
	demonstrated by comparison of work of adhesion values. Upon heating,
	there is a steady decrease in work of adhesion values for the native
	and polished oxide surface. Dehydration (evaporation and condensation
	of silanol groups) can be observed through the work of adhesion values
	as the samples are heated from ambient to 280√Ç¬∞C. The loss of water
	occurs gradually to give a surface which is relatively hydrophobic
	to water. Contact angle hysteresis data indicate that the chemical
	heterogeneity present on the native oxide surface is removed during
	chemomechanical polishing.},

  abstract = {Direct wafer bonding is a manufacturing process that is used in the
	fabrication of electronic, optical and mechanical microsystems. The
	initial step in the process requires that the wafers are sufficiently
	smooth, flat and compliant such that short-range surface forces can
	elastically deform the wafers and bring the surfaces into complete
	contact. Analytical and computational mechanics models of this adhesion
	process as well as experiments that validate these models are presented
	in this work. An energy-based analysis is used to develop the models
	that allow acceptable limits of wafer-scale flatness variations to
	be predicted. The analytical models provide basic insight into the
	process while the finite-element-based model reported provides a
	method to analyse a broad range of realistic cases, including the
	bonding of wafers with etch patterns and arbitrary geometries. Experiments,
	in which patterned silicon wafers with different magnitudes of wafer-scale
	shape variations were bonded, were performed and the results demonstrate
	that the proposed models can accurately predict the size and shape
	of the bonded area based on the wafer geometry, elastic properties
	and work of adhesion.},

  abstract = {Abstract.ÔøΩ The deposition of films with nonuniform residual stress
	can induce local changes in wafer shape and contribute to overlay
	errors with magnitudes that may be significant in advanced lithographic
	patterning processes. Understanding the fundamental relationship
	between residual stress, localized wafer shape changes, and overlay
	error is crucial for realizing new schemes to manage overlay errors,
	particularly at advanced nodes where feature sizes are smaller. In
	the present work, finite element modeling is used to quantitatively
	relate nonuniform residual stress in a deposited thin film to localized
	wafer shape changes and overlay errors. The results demonstrate that
	there is a strong correlation between localized shape variations
	induced by nonuniform residual stresses and noncorrectable overlay
	errors.},
